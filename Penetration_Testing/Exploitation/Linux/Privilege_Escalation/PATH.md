# PATH.md
***
"PATH" is an environment variable found in Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It serves to define a list of directories where executable programs are located. When a user executes a command in the terminal, the system scans these directories within PATH to find the corresponding executable files. To display the current PATH configuration, you can use the following command.
```sh
ech $PATH
```

## Exploitation
An attacker has the ability to modify the PATH variable to point to a directory of their choosing. As an illustration, consider a script, "test.sh," which employs the "ls" command
