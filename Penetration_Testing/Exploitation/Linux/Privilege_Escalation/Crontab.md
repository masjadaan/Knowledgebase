# Crontab
***

- Cron is a background service that runs continuously and checks crontab files for scheduled jobs.
- Crontabs are configuration files that specifies the schedule for running cron jobs. Each user on a Linux system can have their own crontab.
```sh
# location
ll /etc/crontab

# Edit crontabs
crontab -3
```
- Cronjobs are commands that users want to automate at specified times or intervals.

The cron daemon periodically checks the crontab file to determine if any scheduled cronjobs need to be executed.
