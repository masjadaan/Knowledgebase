***
/etc/passwd is a plain text file serves as a repository of system accounts. Various command utilities reference it to map user IDs to user names.

## Format
Each user on the system has one entry per line.
There are seven fields separated by colons :
- Username: Used when a user logs in, limited to 1-32 characters.
- Password:
  - An 'x' indicates an encrypted password stored in /etc/shadow.
  - Some Linux versions may still store password hashes here.
- User ID:
  - UID 0 is reserved for the root user.
  - UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts.
- Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (found in /etc/group).
- User ID Info: The comment field.
- Home directory:
  - The absolute path to the user's directory.
  - If the directory doesn't exist, the user's directory becomes '/'.
- Command/shell: The absolute path to a command or shell (e.g., /bin/bash)."
