# LD_LIBRARY_PATH
***

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable that specifies a list of directories where shared libraries are initially searched for.

- To examine the shared libraries used by a program we can use ldd, let's take apache2 as example:
```sh
lld /usr/sbin/apache2
```

- Generate a shared object by compiling the code in library_path.c and naming it libcrypt.so.1, matching the name of the standard libcrypt.so.1 library.
```sh
gcc -shared -fPIC /path/to/library_path.c -o /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 
```

- set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the full path of the newly created shared object.
```sh
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/apache2
```

- Launch apache2
