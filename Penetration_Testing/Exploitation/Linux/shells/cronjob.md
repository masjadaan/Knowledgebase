Cron jobs, often referred to as scheduled tasks, includes tasks that are executed at predefined intervals. One common use case is automating regular maintenance and administrative tasks. It is usually located in /etc/cron/job. Having root access on a host grants you the privilege to add, modify, or remove scheduled tasks within the "/etc/cronjob" directory. This level of access allows you to customize and automate various processes, making it a powerful tool for system administration and management
